In our festival, you will see people from many different countries from the Middle East, Africa, and around the World. In a world full of division and pride, we are able to come into intimate fellowship through the perfect redemptive work of Jesus on the cross.  Through Him, we have abundant eternal life, unity across language/culture and nationality, and an eternal hope of life beyond the grave.</p>
